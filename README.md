# Quiz Game
A program that will read in a quiz provided via a CSV file and will then give the quiz to a user keeping track of how many questions they get right and how many they get incorrect. There is a timer of 30 seconds default value (can be changed using the timer flag).
  
The CSV file will be in a format like below, where the first column is a question and the second column in the same row is the answer to that question.
```
5+5,10
7+3,10
1+1,2
8+3,11
1+2,3
8+6,14
3+1,4
1+4,5
5+1,6
2+3,5
3+3,6
2+4,6
5+2,7
```
